Hell is multilayered like an onion
Turtle onion
Turtle avocado
Turtle eggshell. 
Chocolate turtle sundae. A turtle fin instead of a banana. Or whipped cream and ice cream and chocolate icing and a cherry on top of a turtle shell.
Crack open an eggplant. There are little purple baby octopi inside with vines for tentacles. Crack open a cactus over a frying pan and little candy stars come out. Winged and limbless mice flutter out from between the cracks in the walls to feast. Swat the mice with a wooden spoon and catch in the pan.
